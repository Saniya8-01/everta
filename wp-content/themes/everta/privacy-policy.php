        <span class="content2p3Span">2. Level 2 Chargers:</span>
        <span class="content2p3Content">These chargers use a 240-volt outlet, similar to what you would use for a dryer
          or oven. They provide faster charging times and are commonly found in homes, workplaces, and public charging
          stations.</span>
      </p> -->
      <!-- <p class="content2p4">
        <span class="content2p4Span">3. DC Fast Chargers:</span>
        <span class="content2p4Content"> These are the fastest chargers available, capable of charging an EV to 80% in
          as little as 30 minutes. They are typically found along highways and in urban areas, catering to drivers who
          need a quick recharge on the go.</span>

  <!-- <div class="sec3Content" style="width: 100%">
    <p class="content3p1" style="">The future of EV charging is set to be transformed by several emerging technologies:
    </p>
    <p class="content3p2">
      <span class="content3p2Span">1. Wireless Charging:</span>
      <span class="content3p2Content"> Also known as inductive charging, this technology allows EVs to be charged
        without the need for cables. By simply parking over a charging pad, the vehicle can receive power through
        electromagnetic fields. This technology is still in its early stages but holds great promise for the
        future.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="content3p3">
      <span class="content3p3Span">2. Ultra-Fast Charging:</span>
      <span class="content3p3Content"> While DC fast chargers are already quick, ultra-fast chargers are being developed
        to reduce charging times even further. Companies are working on chargers that can deliver up to 350 kW of power,
        potentially charging an EV in under 15 minutes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="content3p4">
      <span class="content3p4Span">3. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Technology: </span>
      <span class="content3p4Content">This innovation enables EVs to not only draw power from the grid but also to
        supply power back to it. V2G technology can help balance electricity demand and supply, making the grid more
        resilient and reducing energy costs.<br /></span>
    </p>
    <p class="content3p5">
      <span class="content3p5Span">4. Solar-Powered Charging Stations: </span>
      <span class="content3p5Content">Combining EV charging stations with solar panels can provide a sustainable and
        cost-effective solution for powering EVs. These stations can generate their own electricity, reducing reliance
        on the grid and lowering carbon footprints.</span>
